# Drive Simulator Model

The goal of this repo is to house the development work for a game prediction 
model that is built upon simulating games at a drive level. The basics of the 
model is as follows:

1. Estimate the number of drives in a given game
2. Estimate a distribution for the drive outcomes
3. Sample from the drives a number of times
4. Find the mean/mode/range of scores
